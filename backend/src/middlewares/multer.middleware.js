// The storage refers to the custom storage configuration you defined earlier using multer.diskStorage(...). It tells Multer where and how to store uploaded files on diskâ€”specifically the destination folder and filename format.

// This object is passed into multer({...}) to configure the upload behavior. Without specifying storage, Multer would use its default in-memory storage, which is not suitable for saving files to disk.
// So, this line ties your custom disk storage settings into Multer's upload process.

// Notes:
// The cb is a callback function:
// It takes two arguments: error and destination.
// cb(null, '/tmp/my-uploads') means:
// No error (null)
// Save the file in the '/tmp/my-uploads' directory.
